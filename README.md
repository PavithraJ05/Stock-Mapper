# Stock Mapper
 It is a Python-based tool designed to intelligently map sector-wise stock names to their corresponding NSE symbols and official company names.
 It tackles the common problem of inconsistencies in stock naming conventions across different datasets by employing a combination of cleaning techniques,
 rule-based matching, and fuzzy string matching using the fuzzywuzzy library.
